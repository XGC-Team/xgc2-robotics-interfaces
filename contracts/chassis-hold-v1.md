# Chassis HOLD v1

The native output owner implements one fixed roster of 1–16 robot IDs and a
32-slot queue. The SDK owns HTTP parsing, limits, binding and endpoint leases.
There is no per-robot listener or management worker. In embedded mode the
provider shares the app's actual ServiceRef instance, listener, IO owner and
resolved RuntimePolicy. It does not resolve another environment snapshot.

GET `/v1/chassis/descriptor` is the declared discovery route and returns the
complete `chassis.hold`, API `1`, `http.v1` ServiceRef, roster and limits.
GET `/v1/chassis/runtime-policy` reports the actually enforced host policy.
GET `/v1/chassis/hold` runs a bounded observation on the native control owner.

POST `/v1/chassis/hold` takes exactly:

```json
{"expected_revision":0,"changes":[{"robot_id":"robot-1","held":true}]}
```

Revision is an unsigned JSON integer; changes contain 1–16 unique known IDs
and booleans. Unknown fields, duplicates and integer-shaped floats are invalid.
The native owner validates the whole batch and CAS before writes, masks every
selected robot, and applies zero to every native command output. It reports
`stage:applied` only after all zero sinks return successfully. Failed native
writes leave the entire selected batch held and advance the visible revision;
the result states each `zero_applied` outcome. No rollback is claimed.

Release also clears cached commands and applies zero before opening the gate;
it never replays a command accepted before or during HOLD. All command
acceptance and native output writes must share the embedding app's gate with
the control executor. The pure State class is exclusively owned, not internally
thread safe. A Gazebo RT producer uses a try gate and skips contention.

Completion is `command-gated`, with `physical_stop_confirmed:false`: native
output zero is confirmed; inertia, contact and measured physical rest are
separate facts. A missing output owner is a native write failure, not success.
Receipts report revision, every robot's actual held state, and per-change zero
completion. There is no durable state or cross-instance recovery promise.

The domain body limit is 4096 bytes and queued admission lasts at most 250 ms,
even when the embedded app permits larger general requests. A caller leaving
does not undo an executing write. The host retains admitted work until native
completion and releases reply leases after quiescence. Do not automatically
retry mutations after a lost response; inspect the bound native revision/state.
